# Decentralized P2P Chat Application Requirements Brief

## Overview
A secure, decentralized peer-to-peer chat application leveraging blockchain technology for connection management and WebRTC for direct communication.

## Core Components

1. Peer-to-Peer Connection
   - Utilize WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer communication
   - Implement functions for creating peer connections, starting chat rooms, and joining existing rooms
   - Ensure compatibility with the existing `p2p-connection` module

2. Blockchain Integration
   - Integrate with Cardano blockchain for secure connection management
   - Implement transaction creation and verification for establishing and terminating connections
   - Develop a wallet connection feature for user authentication

3. Message Handling
   - Use WebRTC data channels for sending and receiving encrypted messages
   - Implement message encryption using AES keys
   - Maintain compatibility with the existing `message-handling` module

4. Key Management
   - Generate and manage RSA key pairs for asymmetric encryption
   - Create and securely exchange AES keys for symmetric message encryption
   - Utilize the existing `key-exchange-component` for cryptographic operations

5. Connection Management
   - Implement blockchain-verified initial connection establishment
   - Develop functionality for unilateral connection termination via blockchain transaction
   - Create a system for managing active connections and their states

6. User Interface
   - Design interfaces for wallet connection, chat initiation, messaging, and connection management
   - Implement notifications for connection status changes (establishment, termination)
   - Create a user-friendly process for reconnection after termination

## Detailed Requirements

### Blockchain Integration
1. Implement wallet connection functionality
2. Develop functions to create and submit Cardano transactions for connection management
3. Create a verification system for checking transaction confirmations

### Connection Lifecycle
1. Initial Connection:
   - Both parties must submit a blockchain transaction
   - Verify both transactions before establishing the WebRTC connection
2. Active Connection:
   - Maintain WebRTC connection for real-time chat
   - No blockchain interactions required for regular messages
3. Connection Termination:
   - Allow either party to submit a termination transaction
   - Implement immediate connection severing for both parties upon termination
4. Reconnection:
   - Require new blockchain transactions from both parties to re-establish a terminated connection

### Security
1. Implement end-to-end encryption for all messages using AES
2. Securely manage and exchange encryption keys
3. Ensure no sensitive data is exposed in blockchain transactions

### Data Management
1. Develop a system for locally storing active connections and their states
2. Implement secure storage and retrieval of chat histories
3. Create a data cleanup process for terminated connections

### User Experience
1. Design intuitive interfaces for all stages of the connection lifecycle
2. Implement clear notifications for connection status changes
3. Create helpful guidance for users on blockchain transactions and their purpose

### Testing
1. Develop comprehensive test suites for all new components
2. Ensure integration with existing test suites for current modules
3. Implement specific tests for blockchain integration and connection lifecycle management

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance: Ensure minimal latency in message delivery
2. Scalability: Design the system to handle a growing number of users and connections
3. Privacy: Guarantee user privacy and data protection
4. Usability: Create an intuitive interface accessible to users not familiar with blockchain technology
5. Compatibility: Ensure the application works across different devices and operating systems

## Integration with Existing Codebase
1. Maintain compatibility with existing modules: `message-handling`, `secure-link-generation`, `key-exchange-component`, `p2p-connection`, and `chat-room-management`
2. Refactor existing components as necessary to accommodate new blockchain-based connection management
3. Ensure all new features are thoroughly tested and don't break existing functionality

This requirements brief outlines the key features and considerations for your decentralized P2P chat application, incorporating both your existing codebase and the new blockchain-based connection management system we discussed. It provides a comprehensive guide for further development and implementation of your innovative chat solution.
